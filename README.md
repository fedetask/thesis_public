# Analysis of a dermatoscopic dataset

This repository contains my Bachelor Degree thesis.
I've written this thesis after months of work in the Information Engineering department as internee.

*Melanoma is a very aggressive form of skin cancer that develops from the pigment-containing cells known as melanocytes and it’s one of the most dangerous type of skin cancer. An early diagnosis is essential to increase survival chances. An abnormal evolution in size of a skin lesion can be a symptom of melanoma. Understanding how skin lesions evolve over time can be useful to set an upper bound to the normal lesion size variations. The MoleMapper [1] application assists dermatologists in the diagnosis of skin cancers through an automated analysis of the lesion images. We implement its segmentation algorithm to analyze a dataset of dermatoscopic images and extract statistics about the normal variation of lesions area over time. The dataset was obtained from two years of use of the MoleMapper application installed in two tablets used by dermatologists. First, we recover the data and create Java classes to use the data in the segmentation program. Then, we develop a set of Java classes that perform the segmentation. We modify the algorithm to work with cropped images and we change the way area is computed to improve its precision. We analyze some calibration images and then the entire dataset. Calibration images are important to determine the accuracy of our program. Comparing the results of the analysis with the calibration error values we can prove an idea about the average variation rate of lesions area.*

Not everything discovered and developed during my research is already public.
Results, in particular, are still *secret*, since they could be used in commercial application and/or published once they're reviewed.
